    "# Histograms of Color\n",

    "Let's go back to our classification task: classifying images as day or night. You've looked at using raw pixel values to construct a brightness feature and now we'll look at histograms of pixel intensity (color histograms) as **feature vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features can be arrays of useful values. Even the filtered images you've been creating are considered feature extracted images. Feature vectors are 1D arrays (or lists) of values, and they can be used when a single value is just not enough to classify an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you'll see how to create a common type of feature vector: a **histogram**. A histogram is a graphical display of data that shows bars of different heights. Each bar groups data (in this case, pixel values) into ranges and the height of each bar indicates the number of times the data falls into that range. So, a taller bar show that more data falls in that specific range.\n",
