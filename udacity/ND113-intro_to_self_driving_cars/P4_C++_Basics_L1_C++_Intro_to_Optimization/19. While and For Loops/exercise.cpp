    // in the same program.

    // For example, write a for loop that iterates from 0 to 80.
    // If the iterator is greater than or equal to 0 but less than 10,
    //      output the phrase 'slow'
    // If the iterator is between 10 inclusive
    //      and less than 30, output the phrase 'medium'
    // If the iterator is between 30 inclusive and 70, output the phrase 'fast'
    // If the iterator is greater than 70 inclusive, output the phrase 'too fast'
